            Film production can be done by anyone if given the tools and knowledge. The process of making a film can be informative as well as creative, depending on the goal(s) that a director strives for. Films often have a message to give to audiences without it being direct. It can make the viewer curious about what the story is trying to tell, which could mean that it was successful since it captures the interest of the viewer. Without a clear direction though, it can leave viewers bored and confused. Creating a film will take a team to come together to produce it, which can achieve a director's vision. It can also only do the best it can with the budget provided, so it can get expensive trying to produce a visionary piece.

            When starting in film production, it&#39;s important to understand the basis of communication, as it gives audiences an understanding of what the film is trying to convey. Is there a problem in today&#39;s world that needs to be addressed? How do we address that problem without being direct? Are there ways that we can make the audience ponder over certain scenes/dialogue that can change their perspectives? When producing a film, it&#39;s important to know the direction of where the film needs to go, or else it becomes a passing thought. Depending on the audience, it should resonate with them in some way.

          From Emily Edwards&#700; <i>Intercollegiate and Community Collaboration: Film Productions for Students and Community Volunteers</i>, they observed students from various projects collaborating together. In a school setting, putting together a film was seen as competition as students would attempt to put themselves above the rest. There would be attempts at outdoing each other and wanting to prove that they can do well in a professional setting. While it could be beneficial when getting to the top, institutional practice is different from professional. The most important thing to note when working on sets with various people is that collaboration is crucial. Collaboration is crucial because you&#39;re working with individuals who want to pursue the same goals.

            When creating a film, keep in mind the budget you have before beginning to produce. Independent filmmakers use their own money while studios have bigger budgets that often have a lot more equipment and can bring on well-paid actors. In the article, <i>The Costs of Outside Equity Control: Evidence from Motion Picture Financing Decisions</i>, C. Edward Fee (2002) found that independent financing <q>increases when the filmmaker&#39;s artistic stake is high and when the importance of filmmaker effort is relatively high</q> (p. 682). This means that when creative control increases, so does the budget since it would need outside financing.

            When starting your filmmaking journey, there are different factors to consider such as communication, teamwork, and budgeting. Being able to show audiences the purpose of a film draws interest, which then successfully resonates with them in one way or another. In any setting where you have others to do roles during production and post-production, being able to collaborate is important in how your film will result. While budgeting can range from triple digits to hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's ultimately how the director is willing to spend to achieve what you want. When starting filmmaking, anyone can be a filmmaker but it&#39;s the efforts and risks you're willing to take to achieve the outcome you'd like.
